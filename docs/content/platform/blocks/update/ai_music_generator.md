## AI Music Generator

### What it is
A powerful tool that transforms text descriptions into original music pieces using artificial intelligence technology.

### What it does
Creates unique audio compositions based on your written descriptions, allowing you to specify various aspects of the music generation process, including duration, style, and output format.

### How it works
The system takes your text description and other parameters, sends them to an advanced AI music model (Meta's MusicGen), and returns a link to the generated audio file. It automatically retries if there are any issues during generation and ensures the audio meets your specified requirements.

### Inputs
- Text Description: Your written description of the music you want to create (e.g., "An upbeat electronic dance track with heavy bass")
- Model Version: Choice of AI model version (Stereo Large, Melody Large, or Large) for different generation capabilities
- Duration: Length of the generated music in seconds
- Temperature: Controls how creative or conventional the generation should be (higher values mean more creativity)
- Output Format: Choose between WAV or MP3 file formats
- Normalization Strategy: How the audio volume should be balanced (Loudness, Clip, Peak, or RMS)
- Advanced Settings:
  - Top K: Helps control variety in the generation
  - Top P: Influences probability-based generation
  - Classifier Free Guidance: Controls how closely the output follows your description

### Outputs
- Audio File URL: Link to download the generated music file
- Error Message: Information about what went wrong (if the generation fails)

### Possible use cases
- Creating custom background music for videos
- Generating mood-specific music for presentations
- Producing unique sound effects for multimedia projects
- Experimenting with AI-generated music compositions
- Quick prototyping of musical ideas
