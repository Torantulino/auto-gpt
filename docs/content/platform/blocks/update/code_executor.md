## Code Executor

### What it is
A secure environment for running code snippets in various programming languages without affecting your main system.

### What it does
Executes programming code in an isolated sandbox environment with internet access, allowing you to run programs safely while maintaining the ability to install and use external packages.

### How it works
1. Creates a secure, isolated environment (sandbox)
2. Sets up any required dependencies using setup commands
3. Executes the provided code in the chosen programming language
4. Captures and returns the results, including any output or errors
5. Automatically closes the environment after execution

### Inputs
- Credentials: Your E2B sandbox access key for authentication
- Setup Commands: Optional preparation steps, such as installing packages or downloading files
- Code: The actual program or script you want to run
- Programming Language: Your choice of Python, JavaScript, Bash, R, or Java
- Timeout: Maximum time (in seconds) allowed for code execution
- Template ID: Optional custom sandbox configuration for specific requirements

### Outputs
- Response: The main result of your code execution
- Standard Output: Regular program output and messages
- Standard Error: Any error messages or warnings
- Error: Detailed error information if the execution fails

### Possible use cases
- Testing new code snippets before implementing them in a larger project
- Running experiments with different programming languages
- Teaching programming concepts in a safe environment
- Testing scripts that require specific system configurations
- Executing code that needs isolation from the main system
