## HTTP Request Handler

### What it is
A utility component that simplifies the process of making HTTP GET requests to web services and APIs.

### What it does
Fetches data from specified web addresses (URLs) and returns the response in either JSON format or plain text, depending on your needs.

### How it works
When given a web address, this component sends a request to that address, optionally including any specified headers. It then processes the response and returns it in your preferred format (either structured JSON data or plain text).

### Inputs
- URL: The web address you want to fetch data from
- Headers: Optional additional information to send with the request (such as authentication tokens or content preferences)
- JSON Flag: A simple yes/no option that determines whether the response should be processed as JSON data

### Outputs
- When JSON is requested: Structured data that can be easily processed
- When JSON is not requested: Plain text content from the web address

### Possible use cases
- Fetching weather data from a weather service API
- Retrieving user profile information from a social media platform
- Downloading content from web services
- Checking the status of external services
- Integrating with third-party data providers

### Best Practices
- Always provide valid URLs
- Include appropriate headers when accessing secured services
- Use JSON output when working with API responses
- Handle potential connection errors appropriately
