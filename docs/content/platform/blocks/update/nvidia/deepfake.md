## Nvidia Deepfake Detector

### What it is
A specialized tool that analyzes images to determine if they have been artificially created or manipulated using deepfake technology.

### What it does
This component examines uploaded images using Nvidia's advanced AI technology to detect signs of artificial manipulation or generation. It provides a confidence score indicating how likely an image is to be a deepfake, and can optionally return a marked version of the image highlighting areas of potential manipulation.

### How it works
When you submit an image, the system:
1. Securely sends your image to Nvidia's AI analysis service
2. Processes the image using advanced detection algorithms
3. Evaluates the likelihood of artificial manipulation
4. Returns results including a probability score and optional marked image
5. Provides a status update on the analysis process

### Inputs
- Image: The digital image you want to analyze for potential manipulation
- Return Image Option: Choose whether you want to receive a marked version of the analyzed image
- Credentials: Your Nvidia API access credentials (handled automatically by the system)

### Outputs
- Detection Status: Indicates if the analysis was successful, encountered an error, or was filtered for content
- Deepfake Probability: A score between 0 and 1 indicating how likely the image is to be artificially manipulated (higher numbers indicate greater likelihood of manipulation)
- Processed Image: If requested, a version of your image with visual indicators showing areas of potential manipulation

### Possible use cases
- A news organization verifying the authenticity of submitted photographs
- A social media platform automatically screening uploaded content for manipulated images
- A forensics team analyzing evidence for potential digital tampering
- A content moderation team reviewing user-submitted materials
- A fact-checking organization verifying viral images
