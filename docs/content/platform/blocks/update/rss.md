## RSS Feed Reader

### What it is
A tool that automatically reads and processes entries from RSS feeds, which are web feeds that allow users to access updates from websites in a standardized format.

### What it does
Monitors specified RSS feeds for new entries within a defined time window, extracting key information such as titles, links, descriptions, and other metadata. It can either check once or continuously monitor the feed at regular intervals.

### How it works
1. Connects to a specified RSS feed URL
2. Checks for entries published within the specified time period
3. Processes each new entry to extract relevant information
4. If running continuously, waits for the specified polling interval before checking again
5. Delivers structured information about each new entry as it's found

### Inputs
- RSS Feed URL: The web address of the RSS feed you want to monitor
- Time Period (minutes): How far back to look for entries, measured in minutes from the current time
- Polling Rate (seconds): How frequently the feed should be checked when running continuously
- Run Continuously: Whether to keep checking the feed repeatedly or just once

### Outputs

  * Title: The headline or name of the entry
  * Link: The web address where the full content can be found
  * Description: A summary or preview of the content
  * Publication Date: When the entry was published
  * Author: Who created the content
  * Categories: Topics or tags associated with the entry
