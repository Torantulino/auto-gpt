## Slant3D Base Block

### What it is
A foundational component that handles communications with the Slant3D manufacturing service, specifically designed to process and validate 3D printing orders.

### What it does
- Manages communication with Slant3D's manufacturing API
- Validates material and color combinations for 3D printing
- Formats customer orders and shipping information
- Ensures all order details are properly structured before submission

### How it works
The block acts as a bridge between your application and Slant3D's manufacturing service. It takes your order information, validates all the details (like checking if a chosen color is available for a specific material), and prepares the data in the correct format for manufacturing.

### Inputs
- API Key: Your unique identifier for accessing Slant3D's services
- Customer Details:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone number
  - Shipping address
  - Billing address
  - Country information
  - Residential status
- Order Information:
  - Order number
  - File URLs for 3D models
  - Material profiles (like PLA)
  - Color choices
  - Quantities

### Outputs
- Validated color and material combinations
- Properly formatted order data ready for manufacturing
- API responses confirming order details
- Error messages for invalid combinations or requests

### Possible use cases
A custom 3D printing shop could use this block to automate their order processing. When a customer places an order for a blue PLA phone case, the block would automatically:
1. Verify that blue is available in PLA material
2. Format the customer's shipping details
3. Package the order information
4. Prepare everything for submission to Slant3D's manufacturing service

This streamlines the order process and ensures all submissions meet Slant3D's requirements before being sent to manufacturing.
