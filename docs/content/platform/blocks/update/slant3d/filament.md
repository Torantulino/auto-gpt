## Slant3D Filament Manager

### What it is
A specialized tool that connects to the Slant3D service to retrieve information about available 3D printing filaments.

### What it does
This component fetches a comprehensive list of available 3D printing filaments from Slant3D, including details about each filament's color, type, and profile specifications.

### How it works
1. The component establishes a secure connection to Slant3D using your provided credentials
2. It sends a request to retrieve the current filament inventory
3. The system organizes the received information into a structured list
4. If any issues occur during this process, it captures and reports the error

### Inputs
- Credentials: Your Slant3D authentication information needed to access the service

### Outputs
- Filaments: A detailed list of available filaments, including for each:
  - Filament name (e.g., "PLA BLACK")
  - Color code in hex format
  - Color category (e.g., "black", "white")
  - Material profile (e.g., "PLA")
- Error: A message explaining what went wrong if the system encounters any issues

### Possible use cases
- A 3D printing service checking available materials before accepting new orders
- An automated system managing inventory of 3D printing supplies
- A user interface displaying available filament options to customers
- Planning production schedules based on material availability
