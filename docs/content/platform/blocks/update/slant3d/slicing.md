## Slant3D Slicer

### What it is
A specialized tool that processes 3D model files (STL format) to prepare them for 3D printing and calculate associated costs.

### What it does
This component takes a 3D model file, analyzes it for 3D printing, and returns both a confirmation message and the estimated price for printing the model. If any issues occur during the process, it provides detailed error information.

### How it works
1. Accepts a URL pointing to a 3D model file
2. Authenticates with the Slant3D service using provided credentials
3. Sends the file for processing and analysis
4. Returns the processing results and calculated printing costs
5. Provides error information if something goes wrong

### Inputs
- Credentials: Authentication information required to access the Slant3D service
- File URL: The web address where your 3D model file (STL format) is located

### Outputs
- Message: A text response indicating whether the slicing process was successful
- Price: The calculated cost for printing the 3D model
- Error: A detailed message explaining what went wrong (if an error occurs)

### Possible use cases
- Integration with an online 3D printing service platform
- Automated quote generation for 3D printing services
- Quick feasibility checks for 3D printing projects
- Batch processing of multiple 3D models for cost estimation
